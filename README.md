# Advent of Code 2015

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) challenges using PHP.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or later

## Notes

For problems that requires to try different combinations of elements, I used a `brute force` approach to generate all possible permutations.
This is not the most efficient way to solve the problem, but it works for the input sizes of the problems. I will get better ! :smile:
